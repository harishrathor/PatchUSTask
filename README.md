This ouput is correct.

* Output format of first q.:


 $ java CountTrees 
Enter N no of sides of polygon

Enter (x,y) cordinate of 1th side
1 1
Enter (x,y) cordinate of 2th side
2 1
Enter (x,y) cordinate of 3th side
2 2
Enter (x,y) cordinate of 4th side

Total no of trees=12


I am not sure that this output is correct or not because I have used a library which tells the no. of points which are inside
the polygon. So, the output is depending on this library.

It is to be debuged more.
